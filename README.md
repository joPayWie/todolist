With this web app you can manage your tasks, adding the pending ones and checking when completed.

When you first enter the app, you have to set your name. The app will remember it in your device!

Once you have chose your name, you can start adding tasks, by write them in the "Enter a new task" input, and pressing the "Add task" button (you can press "enter" on your keyboard too).

You can check those tasks that you completed, and use the filter to select what tasks you will like to see (pending, complete or all tasks).
